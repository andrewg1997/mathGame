# Overview

I wanted to learn Kotlin and so I created this small program to try it out as I was learning.

The program generates math problems for the user to solve and then checks their answers. So far I only have addition and quadratic equations. I plan on adding more later.
It has a terminal user interface and the program will prompt the user to set perameters like the highest and lowest random number it will generate within the problems.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For the IDE, I used IntelliJ.
The program was written in Kotlin and I used the Scanner library from Java (java.util.Scanner)
I used GitHub for version control and sharing.

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html)
* [programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming)

# Future Work

* Add a feature to export a set of math problems to a PDF
* Add additional types of math problems
* Create a GUI for the program
