# Overview

I wanted to learn Kotlin and so I created this small program to try it out as I was learning.

The program generates math problems for the user to solve and then checks their answers. So far I only have addition and quadratic equations. I plan on adding more later.
It has a terminal user interface and the program will prompt the user to set perameters like the highest and lowest random number it will generate within the problems.
{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Kotlin language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
